# bash lib ![](https://api.travis-ci.org/dansimau/bashlib.svg?branch=master)

bash is terse, esoteric and full of gotchas. You should never use it like a
proper programming language. But...

... there are times when you do. For example, bash is installed pretty much
everywhere, is fast to write (when you've mastered it), decent at managing
tasks, etc.

Here is a collection of snippets and functions that I have created or gathered
over the years. To use these, I generally copy and paste them into a script I
am writing.
